TODO: STATUS Aug 2, 2022: Run report page reading and displaying mge table from wholesaler_data.db,
TODO: need to figure out how to send this to the customer ... email, download, or display in browser?
TODO: display in browser to start?

Currently:
Report needs to be run manually once launched, not automated

Things to be automatic eventually:
2) check_to_see_if_email_needs_to_be_sent(), 1) run_report_based_on_time()
Use Python Anywhere? <-- was a big pain (likely due to trying to save data locally)

Before Launch:
# TODO currently: mge can write to SQL database, decide how to write others...
# TODO currently: (use tables in one DB, try to convert to Postgres?)
# TODO: MGE - spitting "Our Price $xxx" and "Sale Price $xxx" into the same field in the CSV
# TODO: Change various functionality pages to include writing to the google cloud OR a db
# TODO: create a try except framework in writing to each functionality, should make it friendly to running local and nonlocal

After Launch:
    Necessary "real launch" base features:
    1) need to verify FFL status? to not get in trouble, to confirm that they should get access to pricing
        1.1) With that, should I approve new sign ups in this stage?
    2) check password hash and salting, may need a notification (or a "flash") on registration page if password length
    is too short per the requirements
    3) Need to get email for "Wholesale Helper" and use that in the sending of the reports
    4) Extend footer to other pages

    Add on features:
    # 1: Add ability, maybe in a higher tier, to get the report more than once a day at specific times and only on specific weekdays
    # 2: Add ability, maybe in a higher tier, to just get in-stock items in the report
    # 3: Later: make a way for the user to filter the data on the site

Wholesalers still to add: Lipsey's (getting emails, will need to find a way to automate putting into database)
