Currently:
Report needs to be run manually once launched, not automated

Things to be automatic eventually:
1) check_to_see_if_email_needs_to_be_sent(), 2) run_report_based_on_time()
Use Python Anywhere? <-- was a big pain

After Launch:
    Necessary "real launch" base features:
    1) need to verify FFL status? to not get in trouble, to confirm that they should get access to pricing
        1.1) With that, should I approve new sign ups in this stage?
    2)check password hash and salting -- and include stricter password requirements
    3) Need to get email for "Wholesale Helper" and use that in the sending of the reports
    4) Extend footer to other pages

    Add on features:
    # 1: Add ability, maybe in a higher tier, to get the report more than once a day at specific times and only on specific weekdays
    # 2: Add ability, maybe in a higher tier, to just get in-stock items in the report
    # 3: Later: make a way for the user to filter the data on the site

Wholesalers still to add: Lipsey's (waiting on account confirmation)
